    "        The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events occur with a known constant mean rate and are independent of the time since the last event. It is commonly used to model the number of arrivals in a fixed period of time, such as the number of customers arriving at a service point in a given hour, the number of phone calls received by a call center in a minute, or the number of particles emitted by a radioactive source in a given time interval.\n",
