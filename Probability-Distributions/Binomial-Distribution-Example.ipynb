    "The **Binomial Probability Distribution** describes the likelihood of a specific number of successes in a fixed number of independent experiments, each having the same probability of success. It's used to model scenarios where there are two possible outcomes (often termed as \"success\" and \"failure\") in each trial. Examples include flipping a coin, where heads might be considered a success, or determining the number of defective items in a batch of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Characteristics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed Number of Trials**: The experiment is repeated a set number of times.\n",
    "- **Binary Outcomes**: Each trial has only two possible outcomes.\n",
    "- **Constant Probability**: The probability of success is the same in each trial.\n",
    "- **Independent Trials**: The outcome of one trial does not affect the others.\n",

    "1. **Quality Control in Manufacturing**\n",

    "2. **Clinical Trials**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: In a clinical trial, a new drug is tested on 100 patients, and each patient has a 70% chance of responding positively to the treatment. The distribution can be used to calculate the probability of exactly 75 patients responding positively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customer Support**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: A customer support team handles 20 calls per hour, and each call has a 40% chance of being resolved on the first attempt. The binomial distribution can help determine the probability of resolving exactly 8 calls in an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Survey Analysis**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: In a survey, 60% of respondents are expected to prefer a new product. Out of 30 respondents, the probability that exactly 18 will prefer the new product can be found using the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Election Polling**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: In an election poll, a candidate has a 55% chance of receiving a vote from any individual voter. The probability of the candidate receiving exactly 600 votes out of 1000 can be calculated using the binomial distribution.\n",

    "A factory produces light bulbs, and each bulb has a 4% chance of being defective. If a quality control inspector randomly selects 20 light bulbs, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them are defective?\n",

    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we use the binomial probability formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( n = 20 \\) (number of trials)\n",
    "- \\( p = 0.04 \\) (probability of success, i.e., defective bulb)\n",
    "- \\( k = 2 \\) (number of successes, i.e., defective bulbs)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, calculate the binomial coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2 \\times 1} = 190 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, calculate the probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X = 2) = 190 \\times (0.04)^2 \\times (0.96)^{18} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (0.04)^2 = 0.0016 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (0.96)^{18} \\approx 0.4420 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, multiply these values together:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X = 2) = 190 \\times 0.0016 \\times 0.4420 \\approx 0.1347 $$\n",
